# WannaBe
Let's try and keep this updated?

## Set up
- Node (latest version)<br/> 
- Angular 9<br/> 
<br/>
As for the current state of the project there is a working instance in raw HTML and javascript.... I am slowly converting into Angular and then we can extend to makeing it a progressive web app (angular has some simple libraries to do so). If we wanna pivot and use something else, now is the time to do so. 
## Install
A very basic npm install inside the folder wannnabe
```
npm i
```
To run (-o flag opens the browser automatically to localhost:4200)
```
ng serve -o
```

## Working instance
Simply open index.html at the root of the folder (no need )

## Important libraries
- p5.js drawing and creating video output in the browser<br/>
- ml5.js javascript implementation of posnet <br/> 
- tensorflow posenet (this is the actual model that finds the pose estimations) added through npm specifically this library @tensorflow-models/posenet
