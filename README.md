Let's try and keep this updated?

## Set up
So far you just need Node (latest version) and angular 9 latest version. As for the current state of the project there is a working instance in raw HTML and javascript.... I am slowly converting into Angular and then we can extend to makeing it a progressive web app (angular has some simple libraries to do so). If we wanna pivot and use something else, now is the time to do so. 
## Install
```
npm i
```
Then navigate to localhost:4200

## Working instance
Simply open index.html at the root of the folder

## Important libraries
p5.js
ml5.js
tensorflow posenet (this is the actual model that finds the pose estimations) added through npm specifically this library @tensorflow-models/posenet
